# Recommendation Engine using Machine Learning

## Description
I have designed a system that analyses the data set ( movie data set has been taken, which contains 4803 rows and 24
columns) and gives output with graphical representation according to user query like similar movies, movie rating,
popularity, budged, etc.

Tools & Technology: Machine Learning using Python, Scikit Learn.

## Abstract
Recommender system plays a vital role in narrowing down the search of the user and displaying the recommendations based on his choice, his search pattern and the trend. It has application in web search engines, e-commerce websites and video surfing websites. In this project, we will build a recommendation engine using Machine learning. For developing the recommendation engine, Machine learning algorithms will be used to create and analyze the data and Python will be used for coding.

## Introduction
Recommendation lists, created by Recommendation engines, are one of the most prolific utilities of machine learning in everyday experience. Recommendation engines are a class of machine learning techniques that predict a user preference for an item. There are a wide range of techniques available to build a recommendation engine (Kotu and Deshpande 2019).
Recommender systems are information filtering tools that aspire to predict the rating for users and items, predominantly from big data to recommend their likes. Movie recommendation systems provide a mechanism to assist users in classifying users with similar interests. This makes recommender systems essentially a central part of websites and e-commerce applications (Katarya & Verma 2017).

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to design a recommender system helpful in web search engines, e-commerce websites and video browsing websites

## Approach used in
There are three types of recommendation engine viz Popularity based recommendation engine, Content based recommendation engine and Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine. They are briefly defined as below:-

### i. Popularity based recommendation engine:
The trending list in YouTube or Netflix is based on this algorithm. It keeps a track of view counts for each movie/video and then lists movies based on views in descending order (highest view count to lowest view count).

### ii. Content based recommendation engine:
This type of recommendation systems, takes in a movie that a user currently likes as input. Then it analyzes the contents (storyline, genre, cast, director etc.) of the movie to find out other movies which have similar content. Then it ranks similar movies according to their similarity scores and recommends the most relevant movies to the user.

### iii. Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine:
This algorithm at first tries to find similar users based on their activities and preferences (for example, both the users watch same type of movies or movies directed by the same director). Now, between these users (say, A and B) if user A has seen a movie that user B has not seen yet, then that movie gets recommended to user B and vice-versa. In other words, the recommendations get filtered based on the collaboration between similar user’s preferences (thus, the name “Collaborative Filtering”). One typical application of this algorithm can be seen in the Amazon e-commerce platform, where you get to see the “Customers who viewed this item also viewed” and “Customers who bought this item also bought” list.
Another type of recommendation system can be created by mixing properties of two or more types of recommendation systems. This type of recommendation systems are known as hybrid recommendation system.
